Taxes  7.1 The Licensee shall pay, or reimburse Cabot for as the case may be, any taxes, except for withholding tax, subject to Clause 7.2, however designated, arising from or based upon the fees due under this Agreement.  7.2 Cabot shall use reasonable efforts to obtain a tax exemption certificate (or the like) from the tax authorities in which the Licensee resides to entitle the Licensee to claim an exemption from taxes imposed on and to be paid by the Licensee according to the laws of that territory. In the event Cabot is given relief from withholding tax, no income or other tax of any kind shall be deducted from the amount of any license fee and/or royalties payable under this Agreement.

If the Owner fails to make such deposit of the new, corrected or revised Material, NCC Escrow will issue a report to the Licensee detailing the problem with the Material as revealed by the relevant tests.  10.

Indemnity  11.1 Save for any claim falling within the provisions of clause 10.1:  11.2 The Owner and the Licensee jointly and severally agree to reimburse NCC Escrow on an indemnity basis all of its legal and all related costs incurred directly or indirectly as a result of being brought into or otherwise becoming involved in any form of dispute resolution proceedings or any litigation of any kind between the Owner and the Licensee in relation to this Agreement to the extent that this Agreement does not otherwise provide for reimbursement of such costs.  26/06/2006 Page 34 of 47  12. Termination  12.1 NCC Escrow may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to the Owner and the Licensee after failure by the Owner or the Licensee to comply with a 30 day written notice from NCC Escrow to pay any outstanding fee. If the failure to pay is on the part of the Owner, the Licensee shall be given the option of paying such fee itself which option shall expire 14 days after it is notified to the Licensee. Such amount will be recoverable by the Licensee direct from the Owner.  12.2 NCC Escrow may terminate this Agreement by giving 30 days written notice to the Owner and the Licensee. In that event the Owner and the Licensee shall appoint a mutually acceptable new custodian on similar terms and conditions to those contained herein.

Such appointment shall be final and binding on all parties. If NCC Escrow is notified of the new custodian within the notice period, NCC Escrow will forthwith deliver the Material to the new custodian. If NCC Escrow is not notified of the new custodian within the notice period, NCC Escrow will destroy the Material.  12.3 The Licensee may terminate this Agreement at any time by giving written notice to NCC Escrow.  12.4 If the Licence Agreement has expired or has been lawfully terminated or if the licensee terminates the support and maintenance services provided by the Owner under the Licence Agreement, then either the Licensee or the Owner shall give notice to NCC Escrow within 14 days thereof to terminate this Agreement and this Agreement shall terminate with effect from that expiry or termination of the Licence Agreement or the support and maintenance services (as the case may be). Upon receipt of such notice from the Owner, NCC Escrow shall notify the Licensee of the Owner*s notice to terminate and unless within 14 days of the date of such notice from NCC Escrow the Licensee delivers to NCC Escrow a counter-notice signed by a duly authorised officer of the Licensee disputing the termination of the Licence Agreement, then the Licensee shall be deemed to have consented to such termination. Any disputes arising under this clause shall be dealt with in accordance with clauses 6.5 to 6.8.  12.5 Without prejudice to any other provisions herein, NCC Escrow shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon 30 days notice to the Licensee and the Owner in the event that a Release Event has occurred but the Licensee has failed to apply for release of the Material under clause 6. The Licensee shall have the option of applying for release under clause 6 during this notice period, but if it fails to do so, upon the expiry of this notice period NCC Escrow shall return the Material to the Owner or destroy the Material if NCC Escrow is unable to trace the Owner.  12.6 Subject to clause 12.5, the Owner may only terminate this Agreement with the written consent of the Licensee.  12.7 This Agreement shall terminate upon release of the Material to the Licensee in accordance with clause 6.  26/06/2006 Page 35 of 47  12.8 Upon termination under the provisions of clauses 12.1, 12.3, 12.5, 12.7 or 12.10, for 30 days from the date of termination NCC Escrow will make the Material available for collection by the Owner from the premises of NCC Escrow during office hours. After such 30 day period NCC Escrow will destroy the Material.  12.9 NCC Escrow may upon 30 days written notice to all parties terminate this Agreement if it is unable to verify the legal status of any of the other parties to this Agreement despite having used reasonable endeavours to do so.  12.10 For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement may be terminated forthwith by mutual agreement of all parties hereto and upon such termination, unless otherwise agreed, NCC Escrow will return the Material to the Owner.  12.11 The provisions of clauses 3.2, 7, 8, 9.1, 10, 12.12, 12.13, 12.14 and 13 shall continue in full force after termination of this Agreement.  12.12 On termination of this Agreement the Owner and/or the Licensee (as appropriate) shall remain liable to NCC Escrow for payment in full of any fee which has become due but which has not been paid as at the date of termination.  12.13 The termination of this Agreement, however arising, shall be without prejudice to the rights accrued to the parties prior to termination.  13. General  13.1 The parties shall notify the other parties within 30 days of any change of names or any other material changes that may reasonably be expected to affect the validity or operation of this Agreement.  13.2 The formation, existence, construction, performance, validity and all aspects of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and subject to clauses 6.5 to 6.8 and clause 12.5 the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.  13.3 This Agreement, the Schedules and the Appendix hereto, the Order Form and the Licence Agreement represent the whole agreement relating to the escrow arrangements between the parties for the Package and shall supersede all prior agreements, discussions, arrangements, representations, negotiations and undertakings with respect to such subject matter. In the event of any conflict between any of these documents, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any conflict between these documents and the matters covered in clause 4 of the Licence Agreement, clause 4 of the Licence Agreement shall prevail.  13.4 Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given or made hereunder shall be in writing and deemed validly given or made if delivered by hand or courier or if despatched by pre-paid, registered letter post addressed to the address specified on page 1 of this Agreement (or such other address as may be notified to the parties from time to time) or if sent by facsimile message to such facsimile number as has been notified to the parties from time to time and shall be deemed to be given or made:  (i) if delivered by hand or courier, at the time of delivery;  (ii) if sent by registered first class post, 2 business days after the same shall have been posted;  (iii) if sent by facsimile, at the time of transmission of the facsimile transmission with facsimile machine confirmation of transmission to the correct facsimile number of all pages of the notice.  26/06/2006 Page 36 of 47  13.5 The Owner and the Licensee shall not assign, transfer or subcontract this Agreement or any rights or obligations thereunder without the prior written consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that the Owner may assign or transfer this Agreement in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially of its assets to which this Agreement relates.  13.6 NCC Escrow shall be entitled to transfer or assign this Agreement upon notice to both the Owner and the Licensee.  13.7 Within 14 days of any assignment or transfer by the Owner of any part of its Intellectual Property Rights in the Material, the Owner shall notify NCC Escrow of such assignment.  13.8 This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the parties provided always that nothing shall permit any assignment by either the Owner or the Licensee except as expressly provided herein.  13.9 If any provision of this Agreement is declared illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree that such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law and that such provision shall be deemed to be construed accordingly. If any provision of this Agreement is found by any court, tribunal or administrative body of competent jurisdiction to be wholly or partly illegal, invalid, void, voidable or unenforceable it shall, to the extent of such illegality, invalidity, voidability or unenforceability be deemed severable to that extent and the remaining part of the provision and the rest of the provisions of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.  13.10 Save as expressly provided in this Agreement, no amendment or variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed by a duly authorised representative of each of the parties to it.  13.11 The parties shall not be liable to each other or be deemed to be in breach of this Agreement by reason of any delay in performing, or failure to perform, any of their obligations under this Agreement if the delay or failure results from causes beyond that party*s reasonable control (including, without limitation, fire, flood, explosion, epidemic, riot, civil commotion, any strike, lockout or other industrial action, act of God, war or warlike hostilities or threat of war, terrorist activities, accidental or malicious damage, or any prohibition or restriction by any governments or other legal authority which affects this Agreement and which is not in force on the date of this Agreement).

Cabot will provide Support and Maintenance Services between the hours of 9am and 5pm UK time, Monday to Friday excluding UK public holidays.  If the Licensee requests that Support and Maintenance Services be provided at a location other than the Support Site then Cabot may do so at its sole discretion provided that the Licensee agrees to reimburse Cabot for all reasonable travel and subsistence expenses incurred in providing the Services and proof of these costs is provided.  Support and Maintenance Services will be provided for a period of 12 months (the *Service Period* ) following payment of the Support and Maintenance Fee.  Support and Maintenance Services will only be provided by Cabot in response to direct requests from the Licensee and not from any third party.  1.2 Platform  Cabot will provide Support and Maintenance Services for the Adapted Software using the [Development Platform] described in the Statement of Work.  All Problem Reports generated by the Licensee must be demonstrated using the Development Platform. All [Patches] and [Updates] provided by Cabot will be delivered on this platform, and any development work undertaken by Cabot will be carried out using this platform.  In order for Cabot to provide the Support and Maintenance Services, the Licensee will provide two complete Development Platforms without cost at the [Support Site], and will ensure that during the Service Period, the equipment is repaired, maintained, operational and accessible.  26/06/2006 Page 39 of 47  1.3 Service Definition  Cabot will provide the following Support and Maintenance Services to the Licensee under this Agreement.  1.3.1 Development Support  Cabot will provide support for any of the Licensees own development activities that use the Adapted Software. During each Service Period, Cabot will provide up to 20 man days of Development Support to the Licensee.  This Development Support will consist of technical assistance in respect of the Adapted Software and may take the form of answers to questions, guidance on the use of the Adapted Software, assistance with integration issues, and small amounts of development work.  If Cabot believe that a Development Support request from the Licensee will require significant development effort which is beyond the scope of the Development Support included within the Support and Maintenance Services, then Cabot will offer the Licensee alternative funded support services to meet the request.  1.3.2 Bug Fixes  Bug fixes for the Adapted Software can be requested from Cabot by the Licensee.  To request a bug fix the Licensee must generate a Problem Report which details an alleged malfunction of the Adapted Software.  Cabot will investigate each Problem Report received from the Licensee in order to determine whether the malfunction is the result of a failure of the Adapted Software to materially conform with its specification (an Error).
